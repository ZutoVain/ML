## Description
BangTour
The main objective of our application is to provide users with recommendations on the most efficient and expedient routes to multiple tourist destinations. Furthermore, it offers personalized suggestions for tourist attractions based on user preferences obtained through a survey. The application also presents packages for various tourist attractions, considering factors such as city location, pricing, and tourism rating.

### Recomendation System
Collaborative filtering is a method used to identify items that may be of interest to a user based on the preferences of other similar users. This technique involves searching a large user group and identifying a smaller subset of individuals who share similar tastes to a specific user. By leveraging this information, collaborative filtering can effectively filter out items that the user might like.
